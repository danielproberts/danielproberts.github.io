## Welcome to My GitHub Pages Site

This page will eventually serve as a staging point for all of my past, current, and future projects hosted on GitHub.  Currently, I have one respository available.  It is for a website project I have submitted for the Code Louisville program in which I am currently enrolled.

Current Projects:
  1. [blindspoton.com](http://www.blindspoton.com) - This is a starter site to provide venue reviews to the visually impaired.  It is also hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://danielproberts.github.io/blind-spot-on](https://danielproberts.github.io/blind-spot-on/).


Additional projects will be linked to this page as they are begun.
